Vue Reusable Components, Directives, Prototypes


## Components

- `ReturnTop`
  ```vue
  <return-top :threshold="1/3" :duration="500"></return-top>
  ```


## Directives

- `v-fixed-top`  :  when scroll to a component, makes it fix there
- `v-focus`      :  the same as `el.focus()`
- `v-visible`    :  similar with `v-show` but it changes only visibility which means element will take space


## Prototypes
